The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.
John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.
“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).
It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target.
If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.
The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned.

COURTING KREMLINMr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations.
That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).
It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent.

If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.
