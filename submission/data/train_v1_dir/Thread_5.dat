3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

(NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com###3638||Empty###3639||Empty###3640||Mark Carney has warned that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia Airlines believes the co-pilot aboard the missing plane spoke the last words to ground controllers.

Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that initial investigations indicate that co-pilot is the one who calmly said, "All right, good night."

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point in the March 8 flight when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off.

The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance.

Flight 370###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com###3638||Empty###3639||Empty###3640||Mark Carney has warned that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

Ridiculous London Property Market Facts 1/ 10











However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com###3638||Empty###3639||Empty###3640||Mark Carney has warned that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com###3638||Empty###3639||Empty###3640||Mark Carney has warned that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.
