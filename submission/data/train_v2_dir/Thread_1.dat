In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###1016||American Transit Ridership Hits 57-Year High

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.1006||Image copyright AFP Image caption Fonterra is the world's largest exporter of dairy products

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||###1008||Empty###1009||Empty###1010||Empty###1011||DARLINGTON, England, March 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will delay raising interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent if sterling strengthens further, deputy governor Charlie Bean said on Monday.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

Today Herbalife revealed that it had received a “civil investigative demand” from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulatory agency’s web site says it uses civil investigative demands to look into possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The mere announcement is a much-needed shot in the arm for Ackman’s Pershing Square fund, which has spent nearly $1.2 billion shorting Herbalife shares (i.e., betting that the price will decline). The stock, which was up some 40% since Ackman first announced he was shorting it in 2012, tumbled sharply after the news broke, ending about 7% down on the day’s trading. Herbalife defended itself in a statement on its site:

Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.

The fight over Herbalife has been an oftentimes acrimonious battle between Ackman and other prominent investors who have bet that the stock would rise instead of falling. They include Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb (who held his stake for just two weeks) and George Soros (who trimmed his stake recently).

The contentious scene is eerily similar to Ackman’s six-year campaign against speciality insurance companies MBIA and Ambac back in 2007. Ackman eventually scored a $1.1 billion win on those deals, as documented in the book Confidence Game by former Bloomberg reporter Christine Richard.

Today’s news also comes seven months after Ackman threw in the towel on one of his biggest investments, a bullish bet on retailer JC Penney. That cost him nearly $500 million and dinged his reputation.



The high-profile jousting of billionaire hedge fund managers may look juvenile, but their antics are bringing the money flooding in. According to a recent Moody’s report, assets under management for activist funds—those that, like Ackman’s, put pressure on companies in an attempt to bring about changes that affect the share price—increased by 42% last year, to $93 billion from $65.5 billion in 2012.###1006||Image copyright AFP Image caption Fonterra is the world's largest exporter of dairy products

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

Today Herbalife revealed that it had received a “civil investigative demand” from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulatory agency’s web site says it uses civil investigative demands to look into possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The mere announcement is a much-needed shot in the arm for Ackman’s Pershing Square fund, which has spent nearly $1.2 billion shorting Herbalife shares (i.e., betting that the price will decline). The stock, which was up some 40% since Ackman first announced he was shorting it in 2012, tumbled sharply after the news broke, ending about 7% down on the day’s trading. Herbalife defended itself in a statement on its site:

Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.

The fight over Herbalife has been an oftentimes acrimonious battle between Ackman and other prominent investors who have bet that the stock would rise instead of falling. They include Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb (who held his stake for just two weeks) and George Soros (who trimmed his stake recently).

The contentious scene is eerily similar to Ackman’s six-year campaign against speciality insurance companies MBIA and Ambac back in 2007. Ackman eventually scored a $1.1 billion win on those deals, as documented in the book Confidence Game by former Bloomberg reporter Christine Richard.

Today’s news also comes seven months after Ackman threw in the towel on one of his biggest investments, a bullish bet on retailer JC Penney. That cost him nearly $500 million and dinged his reputation.



The high-profile jousting of billionaire hedge fund managers may look juvenile, but their antics are bringing the money flooding in. According to a recent Moody’s report, assets under management for activist funds—those that, like Ackman’s, put pressure on companies in an attempt to bring about changes that affect the share price—increased by 42% last year, to $93 billion from $65.5 billion in 2012.###1006||Image copyright AFP Image caption Fonterra is the world's largest exporter of dairy products

New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

Maury Leyland, a Fonterra manager said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."

The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.

Charges against Fonterra Processing dairy product not in accordance with its Risk Management Programme

Exporting dairy product that failed to meet relevant animal product standards

Failing to notify its verifier of significant concerns that dairy product had not been processed in accordance with its Risk Management Programme

Failing to notify the Director General as soon as possible that exported dairy product was not fit for intended purpose NZ Ministry for Primary Industries

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||###1008||LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from UK lawmakers on Tuesday about what Bank officials knew about allegations that currency traders colluded to manipulate key exchange rates.

The unfolding scandal has so far seen more than 20 traders placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world’s biggest banks.

Below is a timeline on the scandal that has engulfed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the world’s biggest financial market and which is now subject to a global investigation.

July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour.”

Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with “the relevant authorities in the UK.”

May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say there was “considerable discussion” on the benchmark “fixings” again.

July 2008: A meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion “that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation,” BoE minutes say.

April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers’ meeting included a “brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings,” BoE minutes say.

June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London “fixing”.

July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

Oct 2013: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland’s market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Dec 2013: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi’s main offices in London. Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers’ sub-group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain’s market regulator, says the FX allegations are “every bit as bad” as those in Libor. He also says the FCA’s investigation will probably run into next year.

Feb 5, 2014: New York’s banking regulator opens its investigation.

Feb 14, 2014: The Financial Stability Board, the world’s top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings.

With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

Maury Leyland, a Fonterra manager said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."

The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||###1008||LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from UK lawmakers on Tuesday about what Bank officials knew about allegations that currency traders colluded to manipulate key exchange rates.

The unfolding scandal has so far seen more than 20 traders placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world’s biggest banks.

Below is a timeline on the scandal that has engulfed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the world’s biggest financial market and which is now subject to a global investigation.

July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour.”

Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with “the relevant authorities in the UK.”

May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say there was “considerable discussion” on the benchmark “fixings” again.

July 2008: A meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion “that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation,” BoE minutes say.

April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers’ meeting included a “brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings,” BoE minutes say.

June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London “fixing”.

July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

Oct 2013: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland’s market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Dec 2013: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi’s main offices in London. Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers’ sub-group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain’s market regulator, says the FX allegations are “every bit as bad” as those in Libor. He also says the FCA’s investigation will probably run into next year.

Feb 5, 2014: New York’s banking regulator opens its investigation.

Feb 14, 2014: The Financial Stability Board, the world’s top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings.

March 5, 2014: The Bank of England suspends an employee as part of its internal investigation.###1009||Empty###1010||Empty###1011||DARLINGTON, England, March 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will delay raising interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent if sterling strengthens further, deputy governor Charlie Bean said on Monday.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###1016||American Transit Ridership Hits 57-Year High

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning. The shares were down about four per cent at Rs 580.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.###1019||Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks.

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

Maury Leyland, a Fonterra manager said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."

The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||###1008||LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from UK lawmakers on Tuesday about what Bank officials knew about allegations that currency traders colluded to manipulate key exchange rates.

The unfolding scandal has so far seen more than 20 traders placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world’s biggest banks.

Below is a timeline on the scandal that has engulfed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the world’s biggest financial market and which is now subject to a global investigation.

July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour.”

Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with “the relevant authorities in the UK.”

May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say there was “considerable discussion” on the benchmark “fixings” again.

July 2008: A meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion “that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation,” BoE minutes say.

April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers’ meeting included a “brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings,” BoE minutes say.

June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London “fixing”.

July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

Oct 2013: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland’s market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Dec 2013: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi’s main offices in London. Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers’ sub-group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain’s market regulator, says the FX allegations are “every bit as bad” as those in Libor. He also says the FCA’s investigation will probably run into next year.

Feb 5, 2014: New York’s banking regulator opens its investigation.

Feb 14, 2014: The Financial Stability Board, the world’s top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings.

March 5, 2014: The Bank of England suspends an employee as part of its internal investigation.###1009||Empty###1010||Empty###1011||DARLINGTON, England, March 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will delay raising interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent if sterling strengthens further, deputy governor Charlie Bean said on Monday.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###1016||American Transit Ridership Hits 57-Year High

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning. The shares were down about four per cent at Rs 580.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.###1019||Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

Gold prices edged higher on Monday as the ongoing Russian standoff in Ukraine bolstered the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge, though Friday's strong U.S. jobs report and soft Chinese trade figures watered down gains. Gold gains on Ukraine standoff, soft Chinese data weigh Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday. Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices. Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase. January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000. The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.###
