Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.

EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up 0.48% to 0.8341.

The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low and resistance at 0.8360.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.

The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.

Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.40% to 1.6647.

As of 9:23 a.m. EDT, gold for April delivery was $17.90, or 1.3%, higher at $1,364.60 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It peaked at $1,367.30 an ounce, its strongest level since Sept. 20. May silver was up 25 cents, or 1.2%, to $21.065 an ounce.

“I think what we’re having here is continued nervousness about…the EU (European Union) situation – where the fear of deflation is again taking hold – along with continued worries about the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine leading people into the gold market,” said Sterling Smith, futures specialist with Citi Institutional Client Group.

“Gold seems to be playing its alternative currency card here at the moment,” Smith continued. “We’re seeing most currencies generally steady to a little bit weaker. Gold is one of the few positive items we have out there.”

Gold has also drawn technically oriented buying, Smith said. The metal broke above last week’s $1,355 high and also took out the highs from late October just over $1,360 an ounce. Buy stops were hit, Smith said.

“It’s still coming on the back of the uncertainty in the global economy,” said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist with TD Securities. “China has not been doing particularly well in terms of economic data. And, they had their first-ever corporate default (Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.) within the country and now there are rumors that there is a second one on the near horizon. I guess the question is – where does it go from here and how many more are we going to see?”

This is adding to the safe-haven bid for gold, he said.

“Then you also have the underlying story of the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Dragosits said. “It still has not gone away.”

Ukraine’s Crimea region has been overrun by Russian troops. A referendum has been scheduled in Crimea for Sunday on whether to unite with Russia.

“Russia has said they will recognize it (the referendum) and basically the rest of the world has said they won’t recognize it,” Dragosits said.

A New York desk trader said gold is continuing its bounce from double-bottom support at the end of last year. April gold fell as far as $1,182.30 on New Year’s Eve, coinciding with the low of $1,179.40 from June on a futures continuation chart.

“It’s established a long-term support area and is simply bouncing off of that,” he said. “We have the equivalent of a double-bottom.”

Traders are coming back into the precious metal, encouraged by crises such as the Ukraine issue, he said.

Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, put the next resistance for gold around $1,375. For now, he put support around $1,340 to $1,345. He said some longs may opt to take profits after the run-up.

Gold’s rally is “quite impressive” considering the weakness in many other commodities, Smith said. He pointed out that crude oil is lower, most grains other than wheat are softer, and coffee and cocoa are under pressure.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.###11||The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.###12||Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.###13||Empty###14||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.

The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.

EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up 0.48% to 0.8341.

The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low and resistance at 0.8360.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.

The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.

Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.40% to 1.6647.

As of 9:23 a.m. EDT, gold for April delivery was $17.90, or 1.3%, higher at $1,364.60 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It peaked at $1,367.30 an ounce, its strongest level since Sept. 20. May silver was up 25 cents, or 1.2%, to $21.065 an ounce.

“I think what we’re having here is continued nervousness about…the EU (European Union) situation – where the fear of deflation is again taking hold – along with continued worries about the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine leading people into the gold market,” said Sterling Smith, futures specialist with Citi Institutional Client Group.

“Gold seems to be playing its alternative currency card here at the moment,” Smith continued. “We’re seeing most currencies generally steady to a little bit weaker. Gold is one of the few positive items we have out there.”

Gold has also drawn technically oriented buying, Smith said. The metal broke above last week’s $1,355 high and also took out the highs from late October just over $1,360 an ounce. Buy stops were hit, Smith said.

“It’s still coming on the back of the uncertainty in the global economy,” said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist with TD Securities. “China has not been doing particularly well in terms of economic data. And, they had their first-ever corporate default (Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.) within the country and now there are rumors that there is a second one on the near horizon.

This is adding to the safe-haven bid for gold, he said.

“Then you also have the underlying story of the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Dragosits said. “It still has not gone away.”

Ukraine’s Crimea region has been overrun by Russian troops. A referendum has been scheduled in Crimea for Sunday on whether to unite with Russia.

“Russia has said they will recognize it (the referendum) and basically the rest of the world has said they won’t recognize it,” Dragosits said.

Karl would have heard the news that King.com, the developer of "Candy Crush Saga" was shooting for an initial public offering (IPO) valuing the company at $7.6 billion and nodded. Total enthrallment of the working classes? Cheap at the price!

Let's take a trip through the reality-distortion field that is the current tech boom. "Candy Crush Saga" is an addictive pattern-matching puzzle game that is free to download to your phone. It is a trifle, a divertissement, a way to while away the minutes waiting for the bus or between subway stops. There's no way to sugarcoat this: The pleasure derived from "Candy Crush Saga" is more fleeting and superficial than the joy delivered from sucking on a Sweet Tart. There is nothing socially redeeming, or even interesting about the game.

Did I mention it was addictive? Yes, so much so that players of "Candy Crush Saga" will willingly pay for extra lives or other in-game assistance whenever they get stuck on hard levels or just can't stand the torment of being forced to wait a few minutes for new lives to spawn. The genius of "Candy Crush" is that once you've used up your available "free lives" the game actually restricts you from playing for an arbitrary period of time ... unless you pay up.

The strategy works: In 2013, King.com raked in over half a billion dollars in revenue from in-game fees. "Candy Crush Saga," therefore, only pretends to be free. It is, in fact, one of the most insidiously perfected machines for monetizing distraction and impatience ever invented.

If you're thinking that there's a metaphor at work here describing something essential to how the tech boom is metastasizing, congratulations -- you just made it to the next level! If all goes well with King.com's IPO, a company that pretends its main product is free will be worth billions of dollars.###8||Even as tensions in Ukraine ease with Russian President Vladimir Putin asserting that military intervention is not on the cards and force will be used only as a last resort, the confrontation between Moscow and the West - the most serious since the end of the Cold War - has captivated world energy markets.





Russia's bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for Europe. In particular, with about a third of the continent's natural gas supply coming from Russia - most of it via pipelines passing through Ukraine - any escalation of the conflict there will severely disrupt natural gas availability to downstream customers in Europe, sending prices soaring.Following two prior supply cuts in 2006 and 2009 and a possible third anytime, Europe is on the lookout for other sources that can reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The most viable alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale revolution, is flush with the commodity.With the success of 'shale gas' - the kind trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations - and the advent of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two thirds.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.###11||The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.###12||Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.###13||Empty###14||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.

The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Russia's bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for Europe. In particular, with about a third of the continent's natural gas supply coming from Russia - most of it via pipelines passing through Ukraine - any escalation of the conflict there will severely disrupt natural gas availability to downstream customers in Europe, sending prices soaring.Following two prior supply cuts in 2006 and 2009 and a possible third anytime, Europe is on the lookout for other sources that can reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The most viable alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale revolution, is flush with the commodity.With the success of 'shale gas' - the kind trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations - and the advent of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two thirds.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.###11||The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.###12||Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.###13||Empty###14||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.

The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal 2012.

Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.

Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.87%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.41%.

Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.

EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up 0.48% to 0.8341.

The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low and resistance at 0.8360.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.

The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.

Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase.

Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.40% to 1.6647.

As of 9:23 a.m. EDT, gold for April delivery was $17.90, or 1.3%, higher at $1,364.60 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It peaked at $1,367.30 an ounce, its strongest level since Sept. 20. May silver was up 25 cents, or 1.2%, to $21.065 an ounce.

“I think what we’re having here is continued nervousness about…the EU (European Union) situation – where the fear of deflation is again taking hold – along with continued worries about the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine leading people into the gold market,” said Sterling Smith, futures specialist with Citi Institutional Client Group.

“Gold seems to be playing its alternative currency card here at the moment,” Smith continued. “We’re seeing most currencies generally steady to a little bit weaker. Gold is one of the few positive items we have out there.”

Gold has also drawn technically oriented buying, Smith said. The metal broke above last week’s $1,355 high and also took out the highs from late October just over $1,360 an ounce. Buy stops were hit, Smith said.

“It’s still coming on the back of the uncertainty in the global economy,” said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist with TD Securities. “China has not been doing particularly well in terms of economic data. And, they had their first-ever corporate default (Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.) within the country and now there are rumors that there is a second one on the near horizon. I guess the question is – where does it go from here and how many more are we going to see?”

This is adding to the safe-haven bid for gold, he said.

“Then you also have the underlying story of the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Dragosits said. “It still has not gone away.”

Ukraine’s Crimea region has been overrun by Russian troops. A referendum has been scheduled in Crimea for Sunday on whether to unite with Russia.

“Russia has said they will recognize it (the referendum) and basically the rest of the world has said they won’t recognize it,” Dragosits said.

A New York desk trader said gold is continuing its bounce from double-bottom support at the end of last year. April gold fell as far as $1,182.30 on New Year’s Eve, coinciding with the low of $1,179.40 from June on a futures continuation chart.

“It’s established a long-term support area and is simply bouncing off of that,” he said. “We have the equivalent of a double-bottom.”

Traders are coming back into the precious metal, encouraged by crises such as the Ukraine issue, he said.

Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, put the next resistance for gold around $1,375. For now, he put support around $1,340 to $1,345. He said some longs may opt to take profits after the run-up.

Gold’s rally is “quite impressive” considering the weakness in many other commodities, Smith said. He pointed out that crude oil is lower, most grains other than wheat are softer, and coffee and cocoa are under pressure.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.###11||The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.###12||Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.###13||Empty###14||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.

The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal 2012.

Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.

Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.87%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.41%.

Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.

EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up 0.48% to 0.8341.

The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low and resistance at 0.8360.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.

The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.

Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase.

Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.40% to 1.6647.

As of 9:23 a.m. EDT, gold for April delivery was $17.90, or 1.3%, higher at $1,364.60 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It peaked at $1,367.30 an ounce, its strongest level since Sept. 20. May silver was up 25 cents, or 1.2%, to $21.065 an ounce.

“I think what we’re having here is continued nervousness about…the EU (European Union) situation – where the fear of deflation is again taking hold – along with continued worries about the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine leading people into the gold market,” said Sterling Smith, futures specialist with Citi Institutional Client Group.

“Gold seems to be playing its alternative currency card here at the moment,” Smith continued. “We’re seeing most currencies generally steady to a little bit weaker. Gold is one of the few positive items we have out there.”

Gold has also drawn technically oriented buying, Smith said. The metal broke above last week’s $1,355 high and also took out the highs from late October just over $1,360 an ounce. Buy stops were hit, Smith said.

“It’s still coming on the back of the uncertainty in the global economy,” said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist with TD Securities. “China has not been doing particularly well in terms of economic data. And, they had their first-ever corporate default (Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.) within the country and now there are rumors that there is a second one on the near horizon. I guess the question is – where does it go from here and how many more are we going to see?”

This is adding to the safe-haven bid for gold, he said.

“Then you also have the underlying story of the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Dragosits said. “It still has not gone away.”

Ukraine’s Crimea region has been overrun by Russian troops. A referendum has been scheduled in Crimea for Sunday on whether to unite with Russia.

“Russia has said they will recognize it (the referendum) and basically the rest of the world has said they won’t recognize it,” Dragosits said.

A New York desk trader said gold is continuing its bounce from double-bottom support at the end of last year. April gold fell as far as $1,182.30 on New Year’s Eve, coinciding with the low of $1,179.40 from June on a futures continuation chart.

“It’s established a long-term support area and is simply bouncing off of that,” he said. “We have the equivalent of a double-bottom.”

Traders are coming back into the precious metal, encouraged by crises such as the Ukraine issue, he said.

Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, put the next resistance for gold around $1,375. For now, he put support around $1,340 to $1,345. He said some longs may opt to take profits after the run-up.

Gold’s rally is “quite impressive” considering the weakness in many other commodities, Smith said. He pointed out that crude oil is lower, most grains other than wheat are softer, and coffee and cocoa are under pressure.

Who needs churches or priests to keep the proletarian masses distracted from their oppression when you can keep their attention fixed on the challenge of matching digital candies together on the small screen? Karl would have heard the news that King.com, the developer of "Candy Crush Saga" was shooting for an initial public offering (IPO) valuing the company at $7.6 billion and nodded. Total enthrallment of the working classes? Cheap at the price!

Let's take a trip through the reality-distortion field that is the current tech boom. "Candy Crush Saga" is an addictive pattern-matching puzzle game that is free to download to your phone. It is a trifle, a divertissement, a way to while away the minutes waiting for the bus or between subway stops. There's no way to sugarcoat this: The pleasure derived from "Candy Crush Saga" is more fleeting and superficial than the joy delivered from sucking on a Sweet Tart. There is nothing socially redeeming, or even interesting about the game.

Did I mention it was addictive? Yes, so much so that players of "Candy Crush Saga" will willingly pay for extra lives or other in-game assistance whenever they get stuck on hard levels or just can't stand the torment of being forced to wait a few minutes for new lives to spawn. The genius of "Candy Crush" is that once you've used up your available "free lives" the game actually restricts you from playing for an arbitrary period of time ... unless you pay up.

The strategy works: In 2013, King.com raked in over half a billion dollars in revenue from in-game fees. "Candy Crush Saga," therefore, only pretends to be free. It is, in fact, one of the most insidiously perfected machines for monetizing distraction and impatience ever invented.

If you're thinking that there's a metaphor at work here describing something essential to how the tech boom is metastasizing, congratulations -- you just made it to the next level! If all goes well with King.com's IPO, a company that pretends its main product is free will be worth billions of dollars.###8||Even as tensions in Ukraine ease with Russian President Vladimir Putin asserting that military intervention is not on the cards and force will be used only as a last resort, the confrontation between Moscow and the West - the most serious since the end of the Cold War - has captivated world energy markets.

The only Federal Energy Regulatory Commission/FERC -approved operator in this space with the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has got the first mover advantage. Cheniere is expected to witness earnings growth of 14% in 2014 and 33% in 2015, when first commercial production from the Sabine Pass facility is expected.While Cheniere Energy is clearly ahead of the pack when it comes to natural gas export, there are certain other players that are in line to get federal approval for their terminals. These include's ( D ) Cove Point facility in Maryland,'s ( SRE ) Cameron terminal in Louisiana and ETE )/BG Group Plc's Lake Charles facility, also in Louisiana.As natural gas production in the U.S. soars, domestic prices remain constrained, and the Obama administration speeds up LNG approvals, more and more companies will be eyeing European markets through export. Importantly, this will loosen Russia's energy squeeze on Europe and provide the region with long-term energy security.###9||Empty###10||Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.###11||The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.###12||Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.###13||Empty###14||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.

The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal 2012.

Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.
