Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."

"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the US, while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

The Dubai-based company said they are planning to offer up 22.2 million shares priced between $21 to $24 each which, at the upper end, would value their company at $7.6 billion.

King is the latest mobile games creator to achieve staggering success in the space. In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Irish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.

The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

news@irishmirror.ie###4032||The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend. They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.

On Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.

USD/CNY

As China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.

This Move was Priced In

The move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.

We should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.

This is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy

This is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.

This is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.

Binary Option Take for the Day

We should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.

Discussion:

Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?###4033||It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.

Yes, here is a technology success that has Made in Britain written all over it. Yes, based on these numbers, it will crystallise untold wealth for developers who have toiled away in the capital — a reminder that this is a Tech City now to rival anywhere in the world with the exception of Silicon Valley.

But what a shame that King.com’s backers did not see fit to test the waters of the London market and instead have headed to New York to raise cash.

And then there is the valuation. Candy Crush has been a phenomenon, but King will be lucky if any of the other games in its portfolio turn into such huge hits

To allude to another online game, Angry Birds, here is a company with all its eggs in one basket. It will have to work extremely hard to match these lofty expectations.###4034||###4035||Why did this happen?

Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."

"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the US, while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

Irish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.

The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

news@irishmirror.ie###4032||The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend. They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.

On Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.

USD/CNY

As China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.

This Move was Priced In

The move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.

We should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.

This is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy

This is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.

This is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.

Binary Option Take for the Day

We should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.

Discussion:

Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?###4033||It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

news@irishmirror.ie###4032||The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend. They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.

On Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.

USD/CNY

As China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.

This Move was Priced In

The move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.

We should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.

This is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy

This is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.

This is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.

Binary Option Take for the Day

We should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.

Discussion:

Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?###4033||It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.

Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."

"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the US, while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

Associated Press###4028||King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the hit mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," is going public later this month. The Dubai-based company said they are planning to offer up 22.2 million shares priced between $21 to $24 each which, at the upper end, would value their company at $7.6 billion.

King is the latest mobile games creator to achieve staggering success in the space. In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Their portfolio consists of 180 games across mobile, Facebook and on their own website but there’s no denying that Candy Crush Saga is the breadwinner here. In fact, the single franchise is responsible for around 75 percent of their total revenue. The title has been downloaded more than 500 million times and was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013.

Naturally, many are drawing comparisons with Zynga and Rovio – both of which had hit titles of their own. Popularity in Zynga’s Farmville has waned as its stock price has been cut in half since its 2011 IPO while Rovio has been clinging to the Angry Birds franchise for quite some time now.

Underwriters claim the stock will be priced on March 25 and will start trading the next day under the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol “KING.”###4029||Empty###4030||Rafferty Capital Markets’ Richard X. Bove comments on a recent development in the ongoing Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) tug-of-war between the government and shareholders.

Three Democrats from the Northeast in the House of Representatives are slated to introduce a bill this spring that might preserve the ownership rights of current investors in the Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC). They are John Delaney of Maryland, John Carney of Delaware, and Jim Hines of Connecticut.

Fannie Mae: Key provisions of the legislation

The key provisions of their legislation would be:

Expand the housing finance sector while the private sector accepts the risk.

Create incentives for the private capital in housing to grow.

Separate Fannie and Freddie from government backing.

Create funds for low-income housing.

The government would be involved as a reinsurer of risk. The first loss would be absorbed by private capital and the government would accept the next 95% of the risk in the new financial instruments.

[drizzle]

Representative Carney will be focusing on preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. There is an understanding that if Fannie and Freddie go so will this mortgage. There is also an understanding that without Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) there will be no low-income housing built in this country.

Slowly but surely as the saying goes, the Congress is beginning to understand what they and the Treasury have done. They are strangling housing by forcing a cutback in funds to the sector. Plus, they are forcing housing prices down for every American.

Problems to arise from the Congress

It has been my core belief in getting involved in these stocks that the resolution to Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) problems will not be in the courts but rather it will come from Congress. The Treasury may lose the court cases but this does not mean that it will accept the decisions of the courts.

Congress must set the tone for what is to happen with these companies and it will do so based on the pure political consideration that if Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) goes a new recession will begin.

Congress is beginning to get it. The press remains clueless but it will come around also. The stakes are simply too high to ignore.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the US, while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

Associated Press###4028||King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the hit mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," is going public later this month. The Dubai-based company said they are planning to offer up 22.2 million shares priced between $21 to $24 each which, at the upper end, would value their company at $7.6 billion.

King is the latest mobile games creator to achieve staggering success in the space. In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Their portfolio consists of 180 games across mobile, Facebook and on their own website but there’s no denying that Candy Crush Saga is the breadwinner here. In fact, the single franchise is responsible for around 75 percent of their total revenue. The title has been downloaded more than 500 million times and was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013.

Naturally, many are drawing comparisons with Zynga and Rovio – both of which had hit titles of their own. Popularity in Zynga’s Farmville has waned as its stock price has been cut in half since its 2011 IPO while Rovio has been clinging to the Angry Birds franchise for quite some time now.

Underwriters claim the stock will be priced on March 25 and will start trading the next day under the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol “KING.”###4029||Empty###4030||Rafferty Capital Markets’ Richard X. Bove comments on a recent development in the ongoing Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) tug-of-war between the government and shareholders.

Three Democrats from the Northeast in the House of Representatives are slated to introduce a bill this spring that might preserve the ownership rights of current investors in the Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC). They are John Delaney of Maryland, John Carney of Delaware, and Jim Hines of Connecticut.

Fannie Mae: Key provisions of the legislation

The key provisions of their legislation would be:

Expand the housing finance sector while the private sector accepts the risk.

Create incentives for the private capital in housing to grow.

Separate Fannie and Freddie from government backing.

Create funds for low-income housing.

The government would be involved as a reinsurer of risk. The first loss would be absorbed by private capital and the government would accept the next 95% of the risk in the new financial instruments.

[drizzle]

Representative Carney will be focusing on preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. There is an understanding that if Fannie and Freddie go so will this mortgage. There is also an understanding that without Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) there will be no low-income housing built in this country.

Slowly but surely as the saying goes, the Congress is beginning to understand what they and the Treasury have done. They are strangling housing by forcing a cutback in funds to the sector. Plus, they are forcing housing prices down for every American.

Problems to arise from the Congress

It has been my core belief in getting involved in these stocks that the resolution to Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) problems will not be in the courts but rather it will come from Congress. The Treasury may lose the court cases but this does not mean that it will accept the decisions of the courts.

Congress must set the tone for what is to happen with these companies and it will do so based on the pure political consideration that if Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) goes a new recession will begin.

Congress is beginning to get it. The press remains clueless but it will come around also. The stakes are simply too high to ignore.

Irish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.

The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

news@irishmirror.ie###4032||The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend. They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.

On Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.

USD/CNY

As China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.

This Move was Priced In

The move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.

We should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.

This is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy

This is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.

This is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.

Binary Option Take for the Day

We should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.

Discussion:

Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?###4033||It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.

Yes, here is a technology success that has Made in Britain written all over it. Yes, based on these numbers, it will crystallise untold wealth for developers who have toiled away in the capital — a reminder that this is a Tech City now to rival anywhere in the world with the exception of Silicon Valley.

But what a shame that King.com’s backers did not see fit to test the waters of the London market and instead have headed to New York to raise cash.

And then there is the valuation. Candy Crush has been a phenomenon, but King will be lucky if any of the other games in its portfolio turn into such huge hits

To allude to another online game, Angry Birds, here is a company with all its eggs in one basket. It will have to work extremely hard to match these lofty expectations.###4034||###4035||Why did this happen?
