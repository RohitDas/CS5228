On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.2011||Empty###2012||Empty###2013||Empty###2014||Empty###2015||China's industrial added value expanded 8.6 percent year on year in the first two months of 2014, official figures revealed on Thursday.

Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”###2027||Empty###2028||U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments.

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”###2027||Empty###2028||U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments. He’s worked with the client in question for four or five years “and he was kind enough to allow us to broadcast this news without mentioning his name.”

Guinness, Frances said, spent six months determining the policy was real before awarding the world record.

Although SG has offices in Moscow, Frances wouldn’t bite when asked if the buyer was Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who helped fund Facebook and later paid a record $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills.

SG’s LinkedIn page notes that it’s an investor in venture capital funds run by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale, but Frances demurred when asked if either man bought the policy.

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”2011||Empty###2012||Empty###2013||Empty###2014||Empty###2015||China's industrial added value expanded 8.6 percent year on year in the first two months of 2014, official figures revealed on Thursday.

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Has there ever been an advertising campaign this well-funded that has produced worse results and lamer content than the $700 million devoted to Obamacare? Pajama Boy may be fading into the dim recesses of the national memory, but in his place comes the last resort of desperate marketers: cash prizes. Jonelle Marte of Market Watch reports:

Is this really going to attract anyone? I usually cross the street to avoid "performance artists" like this.

Kyle Pfister, founder of Ninjas for Health, a startup based in Milwaukee that consults for public health agencies, got local musicians talking — and singing — about the law by giving them an artistic task: write a song about the benefits of getting health insurance. After more than 10 artists gathered to sing and record a video for the song, dubbed “Sing Forward,” he engaged other local musicians by challenging them with a competition to see who could develop the best remix of the song.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments. He’s worked with the client in question for four or five years “and he was kind enough to allow us to broadcast this news without mentioning his name.”

Guinness, Frances said, spent six months determining the policy was real before awarding the world record.

Although SG has offices in Moscow, Frances wouldn’t bite when asked if the buyer was Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who helped fund Facebook and later paid a record $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills.

SG’s LinkedIn page notes that it’s an investor in venture capital funds run by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale, but Frances demurred when asked if either man bought the policy.

A spokeswoman for Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla and other high-flying startups, declined to say whether or not her boss was the mystery buyer. An email seeking comment from Oracle CEO Ellison was not answered by press time.

Frances wouldn’t even hint how old the buyer is, although he said his client was hoping to offset federal estate taxes that could take 45 percent bite out of his heirs’ high-end inheritance.

Perhaps most remarkably, Frances’ firm won the client’s business via a direct mail campaign. Who knew that valley billionaires open mass mailings?

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”###2027||Empty###2028||U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments. He’s worked with the client in question for four or five years “and he was kind enough to allow us to broadcast this news without mentioning his name.”

Guinness, Frances said, spent six months determining the policy was real before awarding the world record.

Although SG has offices in Moscow, Frances wouldn’t bite when asked if the buyer was Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who helped fund Facebook and later paid a record $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”###2027||Empty###2028||U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments. He’s worked with the client in question for four or five years “and he was kind enough to allow us to broadcast this news without mentioning his name.”

Guinness, Frances said, spent six months determining the policy was real before awarding the world record.

Although SG has offices in Moscow, Frances wouldn’t bite when asked if the buyer was Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who helped fund Facebook and later paid a record $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills.

SG’s LinkedIn page notes that it’s an investor in venture capital funds run by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale, but Frances demurred when asked if either man bought the policy.

A spokeswoman for Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla and other high-flying startups, declined to say whether or not her boss was the mystery buyer. An email seeking comment from Oracle CEO Ellison was not answered by press time.

Frances wouldn’t even hint how old the buyer is, although he said his client was hoping to offset federal estate taxes that could take 45 percent bite out of his heirs’ high-end inheritance.

Perhaps most remarkably, Frances’ firm won the client’s business via a direct mail campaign. Who knew that valley billionaires open mass mailings?

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Has there ever been an advertising campaign this well-funded that has produced worse results and lamer content than the $700 million devoted to Obamacare? Pajama Boy may be fading into the dim recesses of the national memory, but in his place comes the last resort of desperate marketers: cash prizes. Jonelle Marte of Market Watch reports:

Is this really going to attract anyone? I usually cross the street to avoid "performance artists" like this.

Hannah Conklin, one of the winners announced Wednesday afternoon, recorded herself on Valentine’s Day singing a folk version of the song on a street corner in Asheville, N.C., where she lives now, as two people dressed in heart costumes danced alongside her. “We will sing forward, our health to yours ,” the 28-year-old belted while strumming her red guitar.

Kyle Pfister, founder of Ninjas for Health, a startup based in Milwaukee that consults for public health agencies, got local musicians talking — and singing — about the law by giving them an artistic task: write a song about the benefits of getting health insurance. After more than 10 artists gathered to sing and record a video for the song, dubbed “Sing Forward,” he engaged other local musicians by challenging them with a competition to see who could develop the best remix of the song.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China’s elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or “they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future”, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

“In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people’s cheese will be moved, so to speak,” Li said.

“For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.”

Li also addressed China’s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would “declare war” on pollution.

“To declare a war against smog doesn’t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,” Li said.

“Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.”

He added that “those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable”.

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours — particularly Japan — over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing’s “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

“When neighbours interact with each other, it’s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,” he said.

“But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.”###2027||Empty###2028||U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.

The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.

The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.

According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.

The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.

Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.

Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.

Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.

The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.###2029||Empty###2030||OK

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a “mystery billionaire” has bought what the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most valuable life insurance policy in history: A pact that will pay his survivors a cool $201 million.

Guinness officials said the figure more than doubles the previous record set in 1990 for a policy on the life of an unnamed “entertainment industry figure.” In this case, too, the name of the buyer is being closely guarded.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances, the Southern California financial services provider who sold the policy.

Actually, make that more than two dozen policies, underwritten by 19 different insurers. Frances said if any single company had to pay out such a lavish benefit, it could be crippling.

He wouldn’t say how much his client will pay in annual premiums — “the insurance companies will kill me” — but he allowed that it’s in the single millions of dollars.

Frances won’t be hauling in a percentage of the sale. His firm, Santa Barbara-based SG LLC, charges clients a flat (and one can assume, steep) annual fee for advisory services ranging from asset management to alternative investments. He’s worked with the client in question for four or five years “and he was kind enough to allow us to broadcast this news without mentioning his name.”

Guinness, Frances said, spent six months determining the policy was real before awarding the world record.

Although SG has offices in Moscow, Frances wouldn’t bite when asked if the buyer was Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who helped fund Facebook and later paid a record $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills.

SG’s LinkedIn page notes that it’s an investor in venture capital funds run by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale, but Frances demurred when asked if either man bought the policy.

A spokeswoman for Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla and other high-flying startups, declined to say whether or not her boss was the mystery buyer. An email seeking comment from Oracle CEO Ellison was not answered by press time.

Frances wouldn’t even hint how old the buyer is, although he said his client was hoping to offset federal estate taxes that could take 45 percent bite out of his heirs’ high-end inheritance.

Perhaps most remarkably, Frances’ firm won the client’s business via a direct mail campaign. Who knew that valley billionaires open mass mailings?

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61 percent from the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (3.26 million U.S. dollars) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4 percent growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9 percent growth.

The manufacturing sector saw 9.8-percent growth in added value from January to February, while that of the mining industry grew by 3.5 percent, according to the NBS data.

Regionally, industrial added value from January to February grew by 7.8, 9.4 and 10.3 percent in east, central and west China, respectively, the NBS said.

Xu Gao, chief macroeconomic analyst with Everbright Securities, said the pressure of the country's economic downturn intensified as the country's manufacturing growth retreated to an eight-month low in February.

China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped to 50.2 percent in February, slowing for the third month running, while the HSBC/Markit China flash manufacturing PMI dropped below 50 percent for two consecutive months.

PMI figures above 50 percent indicate expansion while those below 50 percent indicate contraction.

Shen Minggao, chief economist at Citibank, said that China's ongoing reforms will be carried out amid steady economic growth, as stressed in this year's government work report by Premier Li Keqiang.

This year's growth target, set out by Li at the annual parliamentary session last Wednesday, was set at 7.5 percent for the third year in a row.

The slowing economic expansion is still within a rational range as the country is facing a structural adjustment, said Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance.###2016||Empty###2017||Empty###2018||With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Has there ever been an advertising campaign this well-funded that has produced worse results and lamer content than the $700 million devoted to Obamacare? Pajama Boy may be fading into the dim recesses of the national memory, but in his place comes the last resort of desperate marketers: cash prizes. Jonelle Marte of Market Watch reports:

Is this really going to attract anyone? I usually cross the street to avoid "performance artists" like this.

Hannah Conklin, one of the winners announced Wednesday afternoon, recorded herself on Valentine’s Day singing a folk version of the song on a street corner in Asheville, N.C., where she lives now, as two people dressed in heart costumes danced alongside her. “We will sing forward, our health to yours ,” the 28-year-old belted while strumming her red guitar.

Kyle Pfister, founder of Ninjas for Health, a startup based in Milwaukee that consults for public health agencies, got local musicians talking — and singing — about the law by giving them an artistic task: write a song about the benefits of getting health insurance. After more than 10 artists gathered to sing and record a video for the song, dubbed “Sing Forward,” he engaged other local musicians by challenging them with a competition to see who could develop the best remix of the song.

But wait: it gets worse. Obamacare is unleashing lame music, the sort of thing that makes you wish you were at a mime festival instead:

Young Invincibles , a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. that is focused on the economic issues affecting young adults, launched a sweepstakes last week where it is awarding a cash prize of $1,200 — enough to potentially cover a year’s worth of health insurance premiums for a young adult — to people who download their health care app or submit a card in the mail.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform and over the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal. The bipartisan agreement includes measures from Committee Members on both sides of the aisle, the Administration and stakeholders. Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days, and they plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy. This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country,” said Chairman Johnson. “Ranking Member Crapo has been a great partner to work with from the start, and I appreciate all of the important contributions Members of the Committee made to this effort. Specifically, I want the thank Senators Warner and Corker for providing us a strong framework to build on. I look forward to moving this effort through committee once Members have had a chance to review our forthcoming legislation.”

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable. Chairman Johnson and a bipartisan coalition of Senators deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making the hard decisions that will move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from losses.”

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo agree that the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation’s housing finance system. To move forward, the following principles need to be reflected in any housing finance reform legislation:

• Protect taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn.

• Promote stable, liquid, and efficient mortgage markets for single-family and multifamily housing.

• Ensure that affordable, 30-year, fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available, and that affordability remains an important consideration.

• Provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market.

• Facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers in all areas and for single family and multifamily housing types.

Details of the Agreement on Housing Finance Reform

Outlined below are some of the details of the agreement that Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo have reached that will form the basis of a bipartisan housing finance reform text:

• Start with S.1217 as the base text and generally maintain its overall architecture.

• Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

• Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) and market participants.

• Transfer appropriate functions to the modernized, streamlined and accountable FMIC, modeled in part after the FDIC including its regulatory authority.

• Mandate 10 percent private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts.

• Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security, and permit private label securities to be issued in a manner that encourages standardization and improved market liquidity.

• Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved. The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

• Provide clear rules of the road for servicers that choose to participate in the FMIC system.

• Maintain a vibrant multifamily market by building upon successful risk-sharing mechanisms and products and providing access to a broad range of markets.

• Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5 percent (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5 percent.

• Facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

• Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

• Allow current conforming loan limits to be maintained so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high cost areas.

• Maintain broad liquidity in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market and direct FMIC to take into account the impact of new products on the TBA market.###2022||(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###2023||Why did this happen?

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that “everybody is equal before the law”.

“We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,” Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature.

“China is a country that is under the rule of law,” he continued.

“No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.”
