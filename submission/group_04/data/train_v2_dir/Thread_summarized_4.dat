He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."
Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist.
Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.
Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."###4028||King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the hit mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," is going public later this month.

In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

The Dubai-based company said they are planning to offer up 22.2 million shares priced between $21 to $24 each which, at the upper end, would value their company at $7.6 billion.
In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."
Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist.
Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.
