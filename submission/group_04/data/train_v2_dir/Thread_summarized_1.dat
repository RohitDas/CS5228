Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.
The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.
The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.
Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||###1008||July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.
“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.
In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.
In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.
Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population.
Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses.
Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."###1013||Empty###1014||Empty###1015||Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving.
While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations.

Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases.
So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.
For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%.
The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data.###1021||CLCrude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy.
