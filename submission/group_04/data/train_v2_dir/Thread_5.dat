Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

A Penny Saved Could Net Pair $250,000 (by Pam Kragen, San Diego Union-Tribune)###5029||Right Opinion Deflating Russia Can Be Done

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.13% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.15% to Workday WDAY, +0.04% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, -0.02% or even Apple AAPL, -0.78% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

A Penny Saved Could Net Pair $250,000 (by Pam Kragen, San Diego Union-Tribune)###5029||Right Opinion Deflating Russia Can Be Done

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5035||Empty###5036||Let’s bite back on Oracle earnings coverage before it has the chance to bite us. Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.20% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.14% to Workday WDAY, -0.41% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, +0.13% or even Apple AAPL, -0.70% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5035||Empty###5036||Let’s bite back on Oracle earnings coverage before it has the chance to bite us. Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.17% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.19% to Workday WDAY, -0.42% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, -0.13% or even Apple AAPL, -0.70% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.06% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.37% to Workday WDAY, -0.50% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, -0.07% or even Apple AAPL, -0.75% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5035||Empty###5036||Let’s bite back on Oracle earnings coverage before it has the chance to bite us. Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, -0.26% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.54% to Workday WDAY, -1.01% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, -0.09% or even Apple AAPL, -0.60% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5035||Empty###5036||Let’s bite back on Oracle earnings coverage before it has the chance to bite us. Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.17% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -0.19% to Workday WDAY, -0.42% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, -0.13% or even Apple AAPL, -0.70% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.
