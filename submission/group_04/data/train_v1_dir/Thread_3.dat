An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."2179||Billionaire buys $201m life policy BelfastTelegraph.co.uk An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million). https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/billionaire-buys-201m-life-policy-30096631.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article30096630.ece/e190a/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-0492f1af-a60a-4f66-b631-e3611f186509_I1.jpg

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

The report added that the company, behind other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga, would trade as KING on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when it goes public.###2182||Marc Sidwell

OH YES, it’s back on again.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

"Traders were kind of positioned to take profits."

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

"Traders were kind of positioned to take profits."

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

"Traders were kind of positioned to take profits."

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

"Traders were kind of positioned to take profits."

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###2180||China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

The report added that the company, behind other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga, would trade as KING on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when it goes public.###2182||Marc Sidwell

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine."

President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###2184||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."###2186||Empty###2187||Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

"Traders were kind of positioned to take profits."

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’###2190||The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.###2191||The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.
