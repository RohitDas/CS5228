1453||Empty###1454||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian authorities defended their handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 on Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing an international search mission now in its fifth day.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.1453||Empty###1454||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian authorities defended their handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 on Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing an international search mission now in its fifth day.

BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that "everybody is equal before the law".

"We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials," Mr Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp legislature.

"China is a country that is under the rule of law," he continued.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

April gold was last up $1.80 at $1,340.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $0.50 at $1,340.50. May Comex silver last traded down $0.107 at $20.79 an ounce.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.

Follow me on Twitter @jimwyckoff###1453||Empty###1454||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian authorities defended their handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 on Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing an international search mission now in its fifth day.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

AP

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.###1456||Empty###1457||Empty###1458||The Bank of England will overhaul the way it works with banks and financial markets as it faces criticism of its response to signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

April gold was last up $1.80 at $1,340.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $0.50 at $1,340.50. May Comex silver last traded down $0.107 at $20.79 an ounce.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.1453||Empty###1454||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian authorities defended their handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 on Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing an international search mission now in its fifth day.

BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.###1456||Empty###1457||Empty###1458||Empty###1459||These file photos from July 2008 show the Freddie Mac headquarters in McLean, Va., and the Fannie Mae headquarters in Washington.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.###1456||Empty###1457||Empty###1458||The Bank of England will overhaul the way it works with banks and financial markets as it faces criticism of its response to signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that "everybody is equal before the law".

"We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials," Mr Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp legislature.

"China is a country that is under the rule of law," he continued.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

April gold was last up $1.80 at $1,340.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $0.50 at $1,340.50. May Comex silver last traded down $0.107 at $20.79 an ounce.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||China has announced 2014-20 urbanization plan which includes major expansion for transport network and urban infrastructure in the country. The plan includes major investments in infrastructure development as the country aims to increase per capita income with urbanization drive. The State Council introduced the plan on Sunday aims to increase the urban population in China to 60 percent by year 2020.

By year 2020, China aims to connect all cities with population above 200,000 with regular railways. The infrastructure development plan includes high-speed railway link to cities with more than 500,000 residents. The detailed report has been published in Chinese media agency Xinhua. At the moment, nearly 54 percent of China's population lives in urban areas.

As per the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, nearly 35.7 percent of total population holds a "hukou" under China's household registration system. Registered urban population receives social benefits in China. The current move is expected to help nearly 100 million migrant workers.

The first urbanization move started in 1980 in China. The country has managed to become the manufacturing hub due to its cost effectiveness.

Chinese government also plans to expand the social welfare coverage with better options for medical and social insurance for residents. The newly planned urbanization drive is expected to boost the GDP of the country and improve the standard of living for the residents.

The major infrastructure improvement in China could lead to rise in demand and price of commodities in the international market. The last boom in steel and copper prices was seen mainly due to high demand from China.###1456||Empty###1457||Empty###1458||The Bank of England will overhaul the way it works with banks and financial markets as it faces criticism of its response to signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

(Read more: UK grocer Morrisons slashes profit expectations)

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that "everybody is equal before the law".

"We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials," Mr Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp legislature.

"China is a country that is under the rule of law," he continued.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about.

BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

No one was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

The operation was approved by President Barack Obama and was conducted in the early hours of Monday "in international waters south-east of Cyprus".

The Morning Glory "is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of Al-Sidra," the statement read.###1462||Empty###1463||Empty###1464||Empty###1465||A Herbalife logo is shown on a poster at a clinic in the Mission District in San Francisco, California April 29, 2013.

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that "everybody is equal before the law".

"We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials," Mr Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp legislature.

"China is a country that is under the rule of law," he continued.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

April gold was last up $1.80 at $1,340.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $0.50 at $1,340.50. May Comex silver last traded down $0.107 at $20.79 an ounce.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.
