Calm Before the Storm for Gold Prices?

Today's Spotlight Market

Large speculators have been in a bullish mindset of late after adding to their overall net-long positions in Gold the past week. The most recent Commitment of Traders report shows non-commercial traders adding over 6,000 net-long positions during the week ending March 4th. On the other side of the trade were small speculators, who were reported to have liquidated just over 2,800 net-long positions, as well as commercial traders, who increased their overall short position by over 3,200 contracts during this time period.

Fundamentals

Following a price move below 1200.00 to start the year, front month Gold futures have staged a quiet recovery, rallying over $150 per ounce since January. With prices now hovering near 4-month highs, we have seen prices begin to consolidate within a $35 per ounce price band the past 2 weeks as neither bulls nor bears seems to have gained the upper hand at the moment.

Among the top concerns being voiced by Gold traders is the apparent sluggishness in the Chinese economy, which was highlighted by a surprising decline in Chinese exports which fell by 18% in February. Slower growth levels may force analysts to lower their estimates for Chinese commodity demand in the coming months, which can be viewed as a negative for Gold prices. China is believed to be the 3rd largest holder of Gold with an estimated reserve of 2,710 metric tons. Aggressive Chinese Gold purchases the past 5 years had some analysts looking for China to eventually hold as much Gold as that of the U.S., currently at 8,133.5 metric tons. But the timing of additional Chinese purchases remains unknown and it could take decades for the world’s most populous nation to accumulate that much of the yellow metal.

On the positive side for Gold prices, traders note some increased interest in Gold as a “safe haven” investment of late, as heightened geopolitical risks have emerged in Eastern Europe with Russian troops having occupied the Crimean region of Ukraine following the ouster of the nation’s President Viktor Yanukovych. This has led to calls by some political leaders for economic sanctions against Russia, which if implemented, could result in some sort of retaliation by Russia against western nations and potentially heighten global tensions which could trigger a flight back towards Gold by nervous investors.





Technical Notes - View Today's Chart

Looking at the daily continuation chart for Gold futures, we notice the bullish price move off the January lows has taken a bit of breather following a rally of over $150 per ounce. Prices have consolidated just above both the 20 and 200-day moving average although the 14-day moving average has moved out of overbought territory with a current reading of 62.00.

On a longer-term view, there appears to be a “double-bottom” formation on the daily chart going back to the July 2013 low. This could be a sign that a major bottom is in place but we would need to see a close above the intermediate high of 1428.00 to further validate this bullish chart formation. Near-term support is seen at 1317.40, with resistance found at 1355.00.

( URBN ) to post better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2014results. The quarterly earnings of 59 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents and rose 5.4% year over year.

Revenue Insight

Total net sales of Urban Outfitters climbed 5.7% to $905.9 million during the quarter, reflecting healthy comparable-store sales performance coupled with sturdy sales through new store openings and double-digit growth at its wholesale operations. However, total revenue of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million.

Sales were affected due to sluggish performance of the Urban Outfitters brand attributable to adverse weather conditions and weak product execution. Moreover, management hinted that the headwinds faced by the Urban Outfitters brand may impact the performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a result, shares dropped 2.7% during the after-market trading session yesterday.

Urban Outfitters' net sales increased 4.9% to $858 million at the Retail Segment and 23.7% to $47.9 million at the Wholesale Segment. Net sales by brands fell 4.2% to $398 million at Urban Outfitters but jumped 11.7% to $374 million at Anthropologie and 25.7% to $122.9 million at Free People. Other revenue surged 24.9% to $11 million.

Comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, inched up 1%.

Comparable retail segment net sales rose by 20% and 10% at Free People and Anthropologie, respectively, while it declined 9% at Urban Outfitters.

Margin Performance

Gross profit for the quarter rose 5.8% to $332 million, whereas gross margin expanded 4 basis points to 36.7%, reflecting better merchandise margins, partly offset by higher merchandise markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand.

Operating income tumbled 2.1% to $129.1 million, while operating margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 14.3%.

Stores Update

During fiscal 2014, the company opened 38 new outlets, including 16 Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Free People stores and 9 Anthropologie stores, and shuttered 1 Urban Outfitters store and 2 Anthropologie outlets on account of expiration of lease.

Management plans to open approximately 38 net new outlets in fiscal 2015, comprising 13 Urban Outfitter stores worldwide, including three new European stores; 13 Anthropology stores globally, including three new European stores; and 12 Free People stores in North America.

Other Financial Aspects

Urban Outfitters ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $242.1 million, marketable securities of $281.8 million and shareholders' equity of $1,694.2 million. Management expects capital expenditures in the range of $215 million to $235 million for fiscal 2014.

Other Stocks to Consider

Until any further upgrade in Urban Outfitters' Zacks Rank, other well performing stocks in the retail sector include Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI ) and Michael Kors Holdings Limited ( KORS ) both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. ( GIII ) has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).###2916||Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.

Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports.

The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.

Guinness World Records, which announced the policy, said it is the largest ever issued.

Neither the record keeper nor the issuer would say who is covered by the massive policy.

Dovi Frances, the adviser who arranged the policy, would only say it went to a well-known technology billionaire from California.

The wealthiest of the wealthy buy life insurance for several reasons.

Primary among them are tax purposes, Frances explained.

A wealthy estate is hit with a hefty tax bill, and there may not be enough cash to cover it, since many millionaires and billionaires hold their wealth in investments, he said.

The $201 million policy is more complicated than most. It's underwritten by 19 different insurance companies, each with a slice of less than $20 million, he said. If a single lender took the whole policy, Frances said, "they would go into bankruptcy if the insurance policy is called."

And a big plan comes with a big cost. Frances said the price is "in the low single-digit millions."###2905||Empty###2906||You are using an older browser version. Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.###2907||Why did this happen?

Calm Before the Storm for Gold Prices?

Today's Spotlight Market

Large speculators have been in a bullish mindset of late after adding to their overall net-long positions in Gold the past week. The most recent Commitment of Traders report shows non-commercial traders adding over 6,000 net-long positions during the week ending March 4th. On the other side of the trade were small speculators, who were reported to have liquidated just over 2,800 net-long positions, as well as commercial traders, who increased their overall short position by over 3,200 contracts during this time period.

Fundamentals

Following a price move below 1200.00 to start the year, front month Gold futures have staged a quiet recovery, rallying over $150 per ounce since January. With prices now hovering near 4-month highs, we have seen prices begin to consolidate within a $35 per ounce price band the past 2 weeks as neither bulls nor bears seems to have gained the upper hand at the moment.

Among the top concerns being voiced by Gold traders is the apparent sluggishness in the Chinese economy, which was highlighted by a surprising decline in Chinese exports which fell by 18% in February. Slower growth levels may force analysts to lower their estimates for Chinese commodity demand in the coming months, which can be viewed as a negative for Gold prices. China is believed to be the 3rd largest holder of Gold with an estimated reserve of 2,710 metric tons. Aggressive Chinese Gold purchases the past 5 years had some analysts looking for China to eventually hold as much Gold as that of the U.S., currently at 8,133.5 metric tons. But the timing of additional Chinese purchases remains unknown and it could take decades for the world’s most populous nation to accumulate that much of the yellow metal.

On the positive side for Gold prices, traders note some increased interest in Gold as a “safe haven” investment of late, as heightened geopolitical risks have emerged in Eastern Europe with Russian troops having occupied the Crimean region of Ukraine following the ouster of the nation’s President Viktor Yanukovych. This has led to calls by some political leaders for economic sanctions against Russia, which if implemented, could result in some sort of retaliation by Russia against western nations and potentially heighten global tensions which could trigger a flight back towards Gold by nervous investors.





Technical Notes - View Today's Chart

Looking at the daily continuation chart for Gold futures, we notice the bullish price move off the January lows has taken a bit of breather following a rally of over $150 per ounce. Prices have consolidated just above both the 20 and 200-day moving average although the 14-day moving average has moved out of overbought territory with a current reading of 62.00.

On a longer-term view, there appears to be a “double-bottom” formation on the daily chart going back to the July 2013 low. This could be a sign that a major bottom is in place but we would need to see a close above the intermediate high of 1428.00 to further validate this bullish chart formation. Near-term support is seen at 1317.40, with resistance found at 1355.00.

( URBN ) to post better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2014results. The quarterly earnings of 59 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents and rose 5.4% year over year.

Revenue Insight

Total net sales of Urban Outfitters climbed 5.7% to $905.9 million during the quarter, reflecting healthy comparable-store sales performance coupled with sturdy sales through new store openings and double-digit growth at its wholesale operations. However, total revenue of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million.

Sales were affected due to sluggish performance of the Urban Outfitters brand attributable to adverse weather conditions and weak product execution. Moreover, management hinted that the headwinds faced by the Urban Outfitters brand may impact the performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a result, shares dropped 2.7% during the after-market trading session yesterday.

Urban Outfitters' net sales increased 4.9% to $858 million at the Retail Segment and 23.7% to $47.9 million at the Wholesale Segment. Net sales by brands fell 4.2% to $398 million at Urban Outfitters but jumped 11.7% to $374 million at Anthropologie and 25.7% to $122.9 million at Free People. Other revenue surged 24.9% to $11 million.

Comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, inched up 1%.

Comparable retail segment net sales rose by 20% and 10% at Free People and Anthropologie, respectively, while it declined 9% at Urban Outfitters.

Margin Performance

Gross profit for the quarter rose 5.8% to $332 million, whereas gross margin expanded 4 basis points to 36.7%, reflecting better merchandise margins, partly offset by higher merchandise markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand.

Operating income tumbled 2.1% to $129.1 million, while operating margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 14.3%.

Stores Update

During fiscal 2014, the company opened 38 new outlets, including 16 Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Free People stores and 9 Anthropologie stores, and shuttered 1 Urban Outfitters store and 2 Anthropologie outlets on account of expiration of lease.

Management plans to open approximately 38 net new outlets in fiscal 2015, comprising 13 Urban Outfitter stores worldwide, including three new European stores; 13 Anthropology stores globally, including three new European stores; and 12 Free People stores in North America.

Other Financial Aspects

Urban Outfitters ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $242.1 million, marketable securities of $281.8 million and shareholders' equity of $1,694.2 million. Management expects capital expenditures in the range of $215 million to $235 million for fiscal 2014.

Other Stocks to Consider

Until any further upgrade in Urban Outfitters' Zacks Rank, other well performing stocks in the retail sector include Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI ) and Michael Kors Holdings Limited ( KORS ) both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. ( GIII ) has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).###2916||Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.

Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports.

The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.

Calm Before the Storm for Gold Prices?

Today's Spotlight Market

Large speculators have been in a bullish mindset of late after adding to their overall net-long positions in Gold the past week. The most recent Commitment of Traders report shows non-commercial traders adding over 6,000 net-long positions during the week ending March 4th. On the other side of the trade were small speculators, who were reported to have liquidated just over 2,800 net-long positions, as well as commercial traders, who increased their overall short position by over 3,200 contracts during this time period.

Fundamentals

Following a price move below 1200.00 to start the year, front month Gold futures have staged a quiet recovery, rallying over $150 per ounce since January. With prices now hovering near 4-month highs, we have seen prices begin to consolidate within a $35 per ounce price band the past 2 weeks as neither bulls nor bears seems to have gained the upper hand at the moment.

Among the top concerns being voiced by Gold traders is the apparent sluggishness in the Chinese economy, which was highlighted by a surprising decline in Chinese exports which fell by 18% in February. Slower growth levels may force analysts to lower their estimates for Chinese commodity demand in the coming months, which can be viewed as a negative for Gold prices. China is believed to be the 3rd largest holder of Gold with an estimated reserve of 2,710 metric tons. Aggressive Chinese Gold purchases the past 5 years had some analysts looking for China to eventually hold as much Gold as that of the U.S., currently at 8,133.5 metric tons. But the timing of additional Chinese purchases remains unknown and it could take decades for the world’s most populous nation to accumulate that much of the yellow metal.

On the positive side for Gold prices, traders note some increased interest in Gold as a “safe haven” investment of late, as heightened geopolitical risks have emerged in Eastern Europe with Russian troops having occupied the Crimean region of Ukraine following the ouster of the nation’s President Viktor Yanukovych. This has led to calls by some political leaders for economic sanctions against Russia, which if implemented, could result in some sort of retaliation by Russia against western nations and potentially heighten global tensions which could trigger a flight back towards Gold by nervous investors.





Technical Notes - View Today's Chart

Looking at the daily continuation chart for Gold futures, we notice the bullish price move off the January lows has taken a bit of breather following a rally of over $150 per ounce. Prices have consolidated just above both the 20 and 200-day moving average although the 14-day moving average has moved out of overbought territory with a current reading of 62.00.

On a longer-term view, there appears to be a “double-bottom” formation on the daily chart going back to the July 2013 low. This could be a sign that a major bottom is in place but we would need to see a close above the intermediate high of 1428.00 to further validate this bullish chart formation. Near-term support is seen at 1317.40, with resistance found at 1355.00.

The $201 million policy is more complicated than most. It's underwritten by 19 different insurance companies, each with a slice of less than $20 million, he said. If a single lender took the whole policy, Frances said, "they would go into bankruptcy if the insurance policy is called."

And a big plan comes with a big cost. Frances said the price is "in the low single-digit millions."###2905||Empty###2906||You are using an older browser version. Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.###2907||Why did this happen?

Calm Before the Storm for Gold Prices?

Today's Spotlight Market

Large speculators have been in a bullish mindset of late after adding to their overall net-long positions in Gold the past week. The most recent Commitment of Traders report shows non-commercial traders adding over 6,000 net-long positions during the week ending March 4th. On the other side of the trade were small speculators, who were reported to have liquidated just over 2,800 net-long positions, as well as commercial traders, who increased their overall short position by over 3,200 contracts during this time period.

Fundamentals

Following a price move below 1200.00 to start the year, front month Gold futures have staged a quiet recovery, rallying over $150 per ounce since January. With prices now hovering near 4-month highs, we have seen prices begin to consolidate within a $35 per ounce price band the past 2 weeks as neither bulls nor bears seems to have gained the upper hand at the moment.

Among the top concerns being voiced by Gold traders is the apparent sluggishness in the Chinese economy, which was highlighted by a surprising decline in Chinese exports which fell by 18% in February. Slower growth levels may force analysts to lower their estimates for Chinese commodity demand in the coming months, which can be viewed as a negative for Gold prices. China is believed to be the 3rd largest holder of Gold with an estimated reserve of 2,710 metric tons. Aggressive Chinese Gold purchases the past 5 years had some analysts looking for China to eventually hold as much Gold as that of the U.S., currently at 8,133.5 metric tons. But the timing of additional Chinese purchases remains unknown and it could take decades for the world’s most populous nation to accumulate that much of the yellow metal.

On the positive side for Gold prices, traders note some increased interest in Gold as a “safe haven” investment of late, as heightened geopolitical risks have emerged in Eastern Europe with Russian troops having occupied the Crimean region of Ukraine following the ouster of the nation’s President Viktor Yanukovych. This has led to calls by some political leaders for economic sanctions against Russia, which if implemented, could result in some sort of retaliation by Russia against western nations and potentially heighten global tensions which could trigger a flight back towards Gold by nervous investors.





Technical Notes - View Today's Chart

Looking at the daily continuation chart for Gold futures, we notice the bullish price move off the January lows has taken a bit of breather following a rally of over $150 per ounce. Prices have consolidated just above both the 20 and 200-day moving average although the 14-day moving average has moved out of overbought territory with a current reading of 62.00.

On a longer-term view, there appears to be a “double-bottom” formation on the daily chart going back to the July 2013 low. This could be a sign that a major bottom is in place but we would need to see a close above the intermediate high of 1428.00 to further validate this bullish chart formation. Near-term support is seen at 1317.40, with resistance found at 1355.00.

( URBN ) to post better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2014results. The quarterly earnings of 59 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents and rose 5.4% year over year.

Revenue Insight

Total net sales of Urban Outfitters climbed 5.7% to $905.9 million during the quarter, reflecting healthy comparable-store sales performance coupled with sturdy sales through new store openings and double-digit growth at its wholesale operations. However, total revenue of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million.

Sales were affected due to sluggish performance of the Urban Outfitters brand attributable to adverse weather conditions and weak product execution. Moreover, management hinted that the headwinds faced by the Urban Outfitters brand may impact the performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a result, shares dropped 2.7% during the after-market trading session yesterday.

Urban Outfitters' net sales increased 4.9% to $858 million at the Retail Segment and 23.7% to $47.9 million at the Wholesale Segment. Net sales by brands fell 4.2% to $398 million at Urban Outfitters but jumped 11.7% to $374 million at Anthropologie and 25.7% to $122.9 million at Free People. Other revenue surged 24.9% to $11 million.

Comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, inched up 1%.

Comparable retail segment net sales rose by 20% and 10% at Free People and Anthropologie, respectively, while it declined 9% at Urban Outfitters.

Margin Performance

Gross profit for the quarter rose 5.8% to $332 million, whereas gross margin expanded 4 basis points to 36.7%, reflecting better merchandise margins, partly offset by higher merchandise markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand.

Operating income tumbled 2.1% to $129.1 million, while operating margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 14.3%.

Stores Update

During fiscal 2014, the company opened 38 new outlets, including 16 Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Free People stores and 9 Anthropologie stores, and shuttered 1 Urban Outfitters store and 2 Anthropologie outlets on account of expiration of lease.

Management plans to open approximately 38 net new outlets in fiscal 2015, comprising 13 Urban Outfitter stores worldwide, including three new European stores; 13 Anthropology stores globally, including three new European stores; and 12 Free People stores in North America.

Other Financial Aspects

Urban Outfitters ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $242.1 million, marketable securities of $281.8 million and shareholders' equity of $1,694.2 million. Management expects capital expenditures in the range of $215 million to $235 million for fiscal 2014.

Other Stocks to Consider

Until any further upgrade in Urban Outfitters' Zacks Rank, other well performing stocks in the retail sector include Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI ) and Michael Kors Holdings Limited ( KORS ) both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. ( GIII ) has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).###2916||Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.

Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports.

The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.

Guinness World Records, which announced the policy, said it is the largest ever issued.

Neither the record keeper nor the issuer would say who is covered by the massive policy.

Dovi Frances, the adviser who arranged the policy, would only say it went to a well-known technology billionaire from California.

The wealthiest of the wealthy buy life insurance for several reasons.

Primary among them are tax purposes, Frances explained.

A wealthy estate is hit with a hefty tax bill, and there may not be enough cash to cover it, since many millionaires and billionaires hold their wealth in investments, he said.

The $201 million policy is more complicated than most. It's underwritten by 19 different insurance companies, each with a slice of less than $20 million, he said. If a single lender took the whole policy, Frances said, "they would go into bankruptcy if the insurance policy is called."

And a big plan comes with a big cost. Frances said the price is "in the low single-digit millions."###
