The Libyan government said late Monday the Morning Glory, which is carrying a cargo of Es Sider crude loaded by rebels who are in control of the port in eastern Libya, had come under the navy's control.

At a late press conference in Tripoli, Libya's culture minister Amin al-Habib said the vessel was being escorted to a western port and was set to arrive "within hours."

However, early Tuesday, French news agency AFP quoted a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority, as saying the vessel had slipped its escort.



"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," the lawmaker said, according to AFP.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape, and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

Platts was unable to confirm the status of the Morning Glory early Tuesday.

The North Korea-flagged vessel on Monday completed loading a cargo of up to 350,000 barrels of Es Sider crude, but the Libyan navy surrounded the tanker before bringing it under its control.

Tripoli had also threatened to bomb the tanker if it set sail.

The government and state-owned oil company NOC have stressed that rebels in eastern Libya have no legal right to sell oil.

Tripoli has also formed a new armed force that will be charged with liberating three eastern Libyan ports -- Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Marsa al-Hariga -- that have been occupied by rebels since July last year.

—By CNBC###735||A federal prosecutor has kicked off a criminal investigation into General Motors over the company’s seeming foot-dragging on a recall of vehicles with faults that led to the death of at least 13.

The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, CNN Money reported, citing similar stories in Bloomberg, Reuters and The New York Times.

The U.S. attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny the investigation, CNN Money reported. A spokesman for the office said the official normally declined to speak publicly about any investigation that was in the early stages.

GM spokesman Alan Adler said the comment would not comment.

The company faces fire for its slow recall of several models — from the Chevrolet Cobalt to the Saturn Ion — that had ignition switch issues. GM knew of the problems a decade ago, but only issued the recall, which involved ultimately 1.4 million vehicles, in February. Federal law mandates that companies must notify customers of failures and recall alerts within five days of finding the mechanical failure.

At least 13 people reportedly died in traffic mishaps related to the ignition with issue, CNN Money reported.

China has attached high attention on Government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the parliament session.

Citing an official audit of Government debts last year, Li said the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning limit.

After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that Governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of ¥20.7 trillion ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or ¥1.63 trillion, since the end of 2012.

China’s mounting Government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and China has started to take steps to address the issue.

Li said while the level is within control, he cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.

In China, local Governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.

The fiscal funds they receive from the central Government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local Government financing vehicles.

“We will keep the front open and block side doors,” Li stressed at the media conference.

Li also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.

Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.

He said the Government would also continue with the nationwide crackdown on corruption.

“China is a country under rule of law. No matter who he is, and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country, he will be punished to the full extent, because everybody is equal before the law”.

“Corruption is a natural enemy of the people’s Government,” Li said adding, “We must put the exercise of power and the use of public money under institutional checks”.

Li said the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Government are firm in will and determination to fight corruption, and “that is our consistent position”.

The Government will step up its efforts for the release of “a list of powers” and define a clear boundary for the exercise of power to ensure that it is not abused, he said.

The Government will also carry out comprehensive audit in those areas which are of high concern to the public, such as the revenues on the transfer of land use rights and transfer of mining rights, according to Li.

“We will take institutional steps to ensure corruption will have nowhere to hide,” he said.###741||Empty###742||Fed Could Move Again to Keep Short-Term Rates in Check by End of Year###743||Empty###744||Empty###745||###746||During the first month of recreational marijuana sales, Colorado's licensed dispensaries generated a total of more than $14 million, putting about $2 million of tax revenue into state coffers in the process.

The state Department of Revenue released the figures on Monday, which showed how much Colorado has taken in from both medical and recreational marijuana taxes and fees.

The medical marijuana sales for January generated an additional $900,000 in sales tax, for a total tax revenue of $2.9 million for both sides of the state's marijuana dispensary market. Including fees, the figure jumps to $3.5 million.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," Barbara Brohl, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

The figures represent the tax returns from 59 businesses around Colorado, according to the department.

The recreational marijuana tax numbers come from two levies that state voters approved last November -- a 10 percent special sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year -- about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

The first week of sales was robust in the state. With only 37 dispensaries open at the time, they collectively brought in roughly $5 million in total sales.

Although the initial crush of retail pot sales has tapered off since January, sales and tax figures are expected to remain steady with more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, and more added to that list every month.###747||Empty###748||Peter Parks/AFP/GettyImages

China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group confirmed early Sunday that it plans to become a public company in the US.

Rumored to be near for months, a US IPO would "make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency," the company said in a brief note on its Web site. The statement did not indicate which stock exchange the company would choose for its listing.

Alibaba, which controls nearly 80 percent of China's Internet shopping market, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, giving it a $130 billion valuation. That lofty target would challenge Facebook's record Internet IPO, which raised $16 billion in 2012.

Founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, the company provides marketplace platforms that allow merchants to sell goods directly to consumers. Rather than selling goods to consumers as US e-commerce giant Amazon does, Alibaba provides listing and advertising services.

The statement appears to snub the Hong Kong stock exchange, which had been competing for the offering with US stock exchanges but objected to some of Alibaba's proposed listing terms. The company said it was keeping its options open for a possible dual listing in China.

"We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group," Alibaba said in Sunday's statement. "We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong."

The IPO is also expected to a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the China e-commerce giant.###749||A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were shadowing it yesterday, members of Tripoli's parliament said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.

Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.

The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.

The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec member country may slide deeper into chaos.###727||Empty###728||Confusion continues to surround the fate of an oil tanker that loaded a cargo of crude from the Libyan port of Es Sider, with the latest reports indicating the vessel had managed to escape the navy convoy that was accompanying it to a government-held port in western Libya.

“We will keep the front open and block side doors,” Li stressed at the media conference.

Li also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.

Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.

He said the Government would also continue with the nationwide crackdown on corruption.

“China is a country under rule of law. No matter who he is, and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country, he will be punished to the full extent, because everybody is equal before the law”.

“Corruption is a natural enemy of the people’s Government,” Li said adding, “We must put the exercise of power and the use of public money under institutional checks”.

Li said the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Government are firm in will and determination to fight corruption, and “that is our consistent position”.

The Government will step up its efforts for the release of “a list of powers” and define a clear boundary for the exercise of power to ensure that it is not abused, he said.

The Government will also carry out comprehensive audit in those areas which are of high concern to the public, such as the revenues on the transfer of land use rights and transfer of mining rights, according to Li.

“We will take institutional steps to ensure corruption will have nowhere to hide,” he said.727||Empty###728||Confusion continues to surround the fate of an oil tanker that loaded a cargo of crude from the Libyan port of Es Sider, with the latest reports indicating the vessel had managed to escape the navy convoy that was accompanying it to a government-held port in western Libya.

The Libyan government said late Monday the Morning Glory, which is carrying a cargo of Es Sider crude loaded by rebels who are in control of the port in eastern Libya, had come under the navy's control.

At a late press conference in Tripoli, Libya's culture minister Amin al-Habib said the vessel was being escorted to a western port and was set to arrive "within hours."

However, early Tuesday, French news agency AFP quoted a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority, as saying the vessel had slipped its escort.



"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," the lawmaker said, according to AFP.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape, and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

Platts was unable to confirm the status of the Morning Glory early Tuesday.

The North Korea-flagged vessel on Monday completed loading a cargo of up to 350,000 barrels of Es Sider crude, but the Libyan navy surrounded the tanker before bringing it under its control.

Tripoli had also threatened to bomb the tanker if it set sail.

The government and state-owned oil company NOC have stressed that rebels in eastern Libya have no legal right to sell oil.

Tripoli has also formed a new armed force that will be charged with liberating three eastern Libyan ports -- Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Marsa al-Hariga -- that have been occupied by rebels since July last year.

China has attached high attention on Government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the parliament session.

Citing an official audit of Government debts last year, Li said the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning limit.

After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that Governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of ¥20.7 trillion ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or ¥1.63 trillion, since the end of 2012.

China’s mounting Government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and China has started to take steps to address the issue.

Li said while the level is within control, he cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.

In China, local Governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.

The fiscal funds they receive from the central Government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local Government financing vehicles.

The state Department of Revenue released the figures on Monday, which showed how much Colorado has taken in from both medical and recreational marijuana taxes and fees.

The medical marijuana sales for January generated an additional $900,000 in sales tax, for a total tax revenue of $2.9 million for both sides of the state's marijuana dispensary market. Including fees, the figure jumps to $3.5 million.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," Barbara Brohl, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

The figures represent the tax returns from 59 businesses around Colorado, according to the department.

The recreational marijuana tax numbers come from two levies that state voters approved last November -- a 10 percent special sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year -- about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

The first week of sales was robust in the state. With only 37 dispensaries open at the time, they collectively brought in roughly $5 million in total sales.

Although the initial crush of retail pot sales has tapered off since January, sales and tax figures are expected to remain steady with more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, and more added to that list every month.###747||Empty###748||Peter Parks/AFP/GettyImages

China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group confirmed early Sunday that it plans to become a public company in the US.

Rumored to be near for months, a US IPO would "make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency," the company said in a brief note on its Web site. The statement did not indicate which stock exchange the company would choose for its listing.

Alibaba, which controls nearly 80 percent of China's Internet shopping market, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, giving it a $130 billion valuation. That lofty target would challenge Facebook's record Internet IPO, which raised $16 billion in 2012.

Founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, the company provides marketplace platforms that allow merchants to sell goods directly to consumers. Rather than selling goods to consumers as US e-commerce giant Amazon does, Alibaba provides listing and advertising services.

The statement appears to snub the Hong Kong stock exchange, which had been competing for the offering with US stock exchanges but objected to some of Alibaba's proposed listing terms. The company said it was keeping its options open for a possible dual listing in China.

"We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group," Alibaba said in Sunday's statement. "We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong."

The IPO is also expected to a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the China e-commerce giant.###749||A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were shadowing it yesterday, members of Tripoli's parliament said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.

Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.

The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.

China has attached high attention on Government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the parliament session.

Citing an official audit of Government debts last year, Li said the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning limit.

After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that Governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of ¥20.7 trillion ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or ¥1.63 trillion, since the end of 2012.

China’s mounting Government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and China has started to take steps to address the issue.

Li said while the level is within control, he cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.

In China, local Governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.

The fiscal funds they receive from the central Government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local Government financing vehicles.

“We will keep the front open and block side doors,” Li stressed at the media conference.

Li also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.

Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.

He said the Government would also continue with the nationwide crackdown on corruption.

“China is a country under rule of law. No matter who he is, and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country, he will be punished to the full extent, because everybody is equal before the law”.

“Corruption is a natural enemy of the people’s Government,” Li said adding, “We must put the exercise of power and the use of public money under institutional checks”.

Li said the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Government are firm in will and determination to fight corruption, and “that is our consistent position”.

The Government will step up its efforts for the release of “a list of powers” and define a clear boundary for the exercise of power to ensure that it is not abused, he said.

The Government will also carry out comprehensive audit in those areas which are of high concern to the public, such as the revenues on the transfer of land use rights and transfer of mining rights, according to Li.

“We will take institutional steps to ensure corruption will have nowhere to hide,” he said.###741||Empty###742||U.S. consumers began this month feeling more worried about their economic future, according to one survey of households released Friday.

The state Department of Revenue released the figures on Monday, which showed how much Colorado has taken in from both medical and recreational marijuana taxes and fees.

The medical marijuana sales for January generated an additional $900,000 in sales tax, for a total tax revenue of $2.9 million for both sides of the state's marijuana dispensary market. Including fees, the figure jumps to $3.5 million.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," Barbara Brohl, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

The figures represent the tax returns from 59 businesses around Colorado, according to the department.

The recreational marijuana tax numbers come from two levies that state voters approved last November -- a 10 percent special sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year -- about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

The first week of sales was robust in the state. With only 37 dispensaries open at the time, they collectively brought in roughly $5 million in total sales.

Although the initial crush of retail pot sales has tapered off since January, sales and tax figures are expected to remain steady with more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, and more added to that list every month.###747||Empty###748||Peter Parks/AFP/GettyImages

China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group confirmed early Sunday that it plans to become a public company in the US.

Rumored to be near for months, a US IPO would "make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency," the company said in a brief note on its Web site. The statement did not indicate which stock exchange the company would choose for its listing.

Alibaba, which controls nearly 80 percent of China's Internet shopping market, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, giving it a $130 billion valuation. That lofty target would challenge Facebook's record Internet IPO, which raised $16 billion in 2012.

Founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, the company provides marketplace platforms that allow merchants to sell goods directly to consumers. Rather than selling goods to consumers as US e-commerce giant Amazon does, Alibaba provides listing and advertising services.

The statement appears to snub the Hong Kong stock exchange, which had been competing for the offering with US stock exchanges but objected to some of Alibaba's proposed listing terms. The company said it was keeping its options open for a possible dual listing in China.

"We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group," Alibaba said in Sunday's statement. "We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong."

The IPO is also expected to a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the China e-commerce giant.###749||A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were shadowing it yesterday, members of Tripoli's parliament said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.

Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.

The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.

The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec member country may slide deeper into chaos.###727||Empty###728||Confusion continues to surround the fate of an oil tanker that loaded a cargo of crude from the Libyan port of Es Sider, with the latest reports indicating the vessel had managed to escape the navy convoy that was accompanying it to a government-held port in western Libya.

The Libyan government said late Monday the Morning Glory, which is carrying a cargo of Es Sider crude loaded by rebels who are in control of the port in eastern Libya, had come under the navy's control.

At a late press conference in Tripoli, Libya's culture minister Amin al-Habib said the vessel was being escorted to a western port and was set to arrive "within hours."

However, early Tuesday, French news agency AFP quoted a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority, as saying the vessel had slipped its escort.



"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," the lawmaker said, according to AFP.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape, and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

Platts was unable to confirm the status of the Morning Glory early Tuesday.

The North Korea-flagged vessel on Monday completed loading a cargo of up to 350,000 barrels of Es Sider crude, but the Libyan navy surrounded the tanker before bringing it under its control.

Tripoli had also threatened to bomb the tanker if it set sail.

The government and state-owned oil company NOC have stressed that rebels in eastern Libya have no legal right to sell oil.

Tripoli has also formed a new armed force that will be charged with liberating three eastern Libyan ports -- Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Marsa al-Hariga -- that have been occupied by rebels since July last year.

As a reminder for readers, the last change in the band parameters had taken effect back in 2007 and 2012. Today, i won’t be too long before FX traders have CNY on their screens.



According to the PBoC, a two-way yuan fluctuation will become the norm, with the central bank adding that actions taken are aimed towards 'exit from normal fx intervention', despite admitting that yuan exchange rate will continue to be artificially managed on abnormal fluctuation.



The PBoC also said that the band widening is within bearable range for market players. Meanwhile, banks-clients otc trading band will be widened to 3% from 2%.



With a wider band, investors aiming to cash in on the CNY, CNH carry trade should be watchful as the announcement gives the PBoC more room for manuevre to potentially squeeze excessive speculation to appreciate the Yuan, as seen in recent weeks.###730||The Bank of England has unveiled three new high-ranking appointments as governor Mark Carney beefs up his leadership team in the face of damaging claims relating to the global foreign exchange rate-rigging investigation.

—By CNBC###735||A federal prosecutor has kicked off a criminal investigation into General Motors over the company’s seeming foot-dragging on a recall of vehicles with faults that led to the death of at least 13.

The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, CNN Money reported, citing similar stories in Bloomberg, Reuters and The New York Times.

The U.S. attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny the investigation, CNN Money reported. A spokesman for the office said the official normally declined to speak publicly about any investigation that was in the early stages.

GM spokesman Alan Adler said the comment would not comment.

The company faces fire for its slow recall of several models — from the Chevrolet Cobalt to the Saturn Ion — that had ignition switch issues. GM knew of the problems a decade ago, but only issued the recall, which involved ultimately 1.4 million vehicles, in February. Federal law mandates that companies must notify customers of failures and recall alerts within five days of finding the mechanical failure.

At least 13 people reportedly died in traffic mishaps related to the ignition with issue, CNN Money reported.

The IPO is also expected to a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the China e-commerce giant.###749||A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were shadowing it yesterday, members of Tripoli's parliament said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.

Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.

The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.

The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec member country may slide deeper into chaos.###
