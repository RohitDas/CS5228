1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. Whitbread chairman Anthony Habgood will oversee the court of the Bank of England.



George Osborne, who is in charge of appointments to the Bank of England, has been criticised for picking people he ’plays golf with’ to join the Bank. No word on whether Shafik, who is currently deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, ever frequents the fairway – but it’s an encouraging step forward for the all-white, all-male MPC.

This isn't the last we'll hear of the new, improved Bank of England: on Wednesday evening governor Mark Carney will announce a 'radical shake-up' of the way it functions. He's already said he wants to break down the 'silos' and create 'one bank'.

Shafik said this morning she's excited about the chance to 'reshape the Bank's balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank's operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world'.

She follows in some illustrioius female footsteps: the former ladies of the MPC have included an CBI economic adviser and a Shell chief economist...

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.###6||Empty###7||Stock Market Headlines:

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.

The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.

Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.

On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.

Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.

The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank.

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.###6||Empty###7||Stock Market Headlines:

“Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high...,” said Carney in remarks to a committee of lawmakers.

“Our concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market.”

Britain’s recovery to date has been driven by household spending and a revival in the property market. Mortgage approvals in January hit their highest since November 2007.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.

The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.

Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.

On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.

Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.

The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.###6||Empty###7||Stock Market Headlines:

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.

The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.

Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.

On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.

Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.

The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.

News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.

The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan. The interest payment of 89.8 million yuan was due on Friday.

The company became the first domestic company in the corporate bond market to default. It was seen as an indicator that more similar defaults may follow.

Despite the potential boost for stock markets from policy announcements at the ongoing annual two sessions - the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - investors remained cautious last week.

"Investors may be concerned about economic data, property and credit risks," said a research note sent by Shenyin & Wanguo Securities on Friday.

ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board for high-tech and fast-growing start-ups listed in Shenzhen, declined by 1.92 points or 0.13 percent to 1,460.61 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 1.79 percent from the previous Friday.###15||Empty###16||Empty###17||Last Updated: 18 Mar 2014

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. Whitbread chairman Anthony Habgood will oversee the court of the Bank of England.



George Osborne, who is in charge of appointments to the Bank of England, has been criticised for picking people he ’plays golf with’ to join the Bank. No word on whether Shafik, who is currently deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, ever frequents the fairway – but it’s an encouraging step forward for the all-white, all-male MPC.

This isn't the last we'll hear of the new, improved Bank of England: on Wednesday evening governor Mark Carney will announce a 'radical shake-up' of the way it functions. He's already said he wants to break down the 'silos' and create 'one bank'.

Shafik said this morning she's excited about the chance to 'reshape the Bank's balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank's operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world'.

She follows in some illustrioius female footsteps: the former ladies of the MPC have included an CBI economic adviser and a Shell chief economist...

1. Kate Barker CBE (2001-2010)

Previously: Chief economic adviser at the CBI. During her time on the MPC she led two major policy reviews for government, one on housing supply and one on land use planning.

Now: Senior adviser to Credit Suisse, non-executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s oversight board, non-exec director of Electra Private Equity, Taylor Wimpey and Yorkshire Building Society.

2. Marian Bell CBE (2002-2005)

Previously: Set up and ran research function of RBS’s treasury and capital markets division, worked at the Treasury

Now: Member of the Fiscal Policy Panel of the States of Jersey, economics consultant, member of Zurich Insurance’s International Advisory Council.

3. DeAnne Julius (1997-2001)

Previously: Chief economist at British Airways and Shell, senior economic advisor at the World Bank, consultant to the IMF.

Now: Director at Jones Lang LaSalle, non-exec director at Deloitte.

4. Rachel Lomax (2003-2008)

Previously: Permanent secretary of three departments (the Department of Work and Pensions, the Welsh Office and the Department for Transport), vice president and chief of staff at the World Bank, head of economic and domestic secretariat at the Cabinet Office

Now: Non-exec director at HSBC###18||LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $108 a barrel on Monday as an unexpected fall in China’s exports stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya limited the decline.

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###20||Why did this happen?

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. Whitbread chairman Anthony Habgood will oversee the court of the Bank of England.



George Osborne, who is in charge of appointments to the Bank of England, has been criticised for picking people he ’plays golf with’ to join the Bank. No word on whether Shafik, who is currently deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, ever frequents the fairway – but it’s an encouraging step forward for the all-white, all-male MPC.

Shafik said this morning she's excited about the chance to 'reshape the Bank's balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank's operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world'.

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.###6||Empty###7||Stock Market Headlines:

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###
