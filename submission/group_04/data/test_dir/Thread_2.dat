WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."1277||A A

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."1277||A A

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced.

This is a second Symantec CEO that has been fired in less than two years.

Via the Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Bennett had been CEO since July 2012, when he replaced Enrique Salem. A former General Electric Co. executive and Intuit Inc. chief executive, Mr. Bennett had initially joined Symantec as chairman. He aimed to retool Symantec to compete with a new generation of cybersecurity companies. But Mr. Bennett, 60 years old, couldn’t reverse falling revenues and hadn’t yet delivered on new products, former employees and a person close to the board said.

SYMC board member Michael Brown will take over as interim CEO until a replacement is found, the company said.

The computer security company that is known for its anti-virus software work has suffered declining revenue in recent months — down for the last two quarters.

At the end of December, Symantec revenue fell 4.8% to $1.7 billion though income rose 31%, in large part due to the company’s cost cutting.

Symantec said revenue in the current quarter would be $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, down from $1.75 billion last year.

SYMC stock is down 12% in early morning trading, but had been down 15% from last year prior to the news.###1277||A A

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1284||Empty###1285||Why did this happen?

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1284||Empty###1285||Why did this happen?

The used video game market is huge for Gamestop, as it has dominated the space for the past 15 years, returning $1 billion in trade-in credits to customers just last year. Used games accounts for 30% of Gamestop’s annual sales, and nearly 40% of its profits. With Walmart setting its sights on this lucrative business, Gamestop fans are hoping it won’t be "GAME OVER" for the video game purveyor.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and he has grown international retail sales,” he said about Guillon. “I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

It was announced back in January that Mulberry’s profits were substantially low, bringing its share value down by a staggering 22%. Mulberry prices have increased significantly under Bruno Guillon as he tried to step away from “affordable luxury” and make the brand more upmarket.

[Reuters] [Image]###1289||By By Abdul Kuddus Mar 21, 2014 in World Istanbul - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s ban on Twitter has divided Turkey. Apart from domestic backlash against the ban, the move also triggered international condemnation. President Abdullah Gul also sided with the tech-savvy Turks condemning the ban. He reportedly flouted the ban of the social media platform by using his Twitter account to tweet out messages saying, the blocking of Twitter is “unacceptable.” Erdogan defiantly stood by the ban, saying he did not care what the international community thinks about the move. Twitter users considered the ban as a “digital coup.” Some of them even compared Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are firmly monitored. Reportedly, there are about 10 million Twitter users in Turkey. The recent anti-government riots in Turkey saw a rise in Twitter and Facebook users spreading anti-government propaganda. Erdogan is battling a series of corruption scandals that has been fed by social media flooded with alleged evidence of government nepotism and corruption. Links on social networks have increased linking to evidences that seem to implicate the Prime Minister and other top officials in corruption charges. Anticipating threat to his government, Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has tightened Internet controls, as it fights the corruption scandal, which Erdogan considers a plot by opponents to oust him. Erdogan considers the evidence of corruption against him as fabricated plots by followers of an influential US-based Muslim cleric to disgrace his government ahead of the March 30 elections. The Telegraph “The social platform had become a fertile ground for sharing links to leaked recordings that purport to capture corrupt deals being made by members of Erdogan’s administration and even his by own son.” The Twitter ban is the latest in a series of moves by Erdogan's government to restrict Internet freedom that have included the banning of thousands of other websites. YouTube also suffered a two-year ban after the government found videos ridiculing Turkey’s founder, Apart from domestic backlash, the move also triggered international criticism. A notable concern came from European leaders who felt the move violated citizen's rights to freedom of speech and could threaten Turkey's bid to enter the 28-nation European Union.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1284||Empty###1285||Why did this happen?

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1284||Empty###1285||Why did this happen?

Mulberry CEO Bruno Guillon – former managing director at Hermes in France – has resigned after two years with the brand. Mulberry’s non-executive chairman and former CEO Godfrey Davis will take over until a replacement can be found.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and he has grown international retail sales,” he said about Guillon. “I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

It was announced back in January that Mulberry’s profits were substantially low, bringing its share value down by a staggering 22%. Mulberry prices have increased significantly under Bruno Guillon as he tried to step away from “affordable luxury” and make the brand more upmarket.
