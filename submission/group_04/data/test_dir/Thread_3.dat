The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Sberbank And VTB Decline Because Of Ukraine -- Bloomberg###1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake. Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

********************************************************

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he added.###1922||Airbnb in funding talks at $US10bn valuation

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Sberbank And VTB Decline Because Of Ukraine -- Bloomberg###1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake. Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

[R]eports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

[R]eports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||Empty###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Sberbank And VTB Decline Because Of Ukraine -- Bloomberg###1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake. Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

[R]eports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he added.###1922||Airbnb in funding talks at $US10bn valuation

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.
