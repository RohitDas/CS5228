3191||Republican Tennessee Rep. Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that China would be dispatching ships to the area of the object sightings.###3204||Twitter down, what next? On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that China would be dispatching ships to the area of the object sightings.###3204||Twitter down, what next? On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that China would be dispatching ships to the area of the object sightings.###3204||Twitter down, what next? On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that China would be dispatching ships to the area of the object sightings.###3204||Twitter down, what next? On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.
