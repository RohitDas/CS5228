2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this.

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this. In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###2555||Empty###2556||Deals Rumor Mill: Airbnb, Strauss-Kahn, Whampoa

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2560||Empty###2561||Empty###2562||Airbnb, the website emblematic of the “sharing economy” that matches up travelers online with people looking to rent out rooms or entire homes, is close to securing fresh funding that would value the business at $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported this morning.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this.

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz###2574||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

(See also: Investors not buying gold bounce despite Ukraine tension)

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this.

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2560||Empty###2561||Empty###2562||Airbnb, the website emblematic of the “sharing economy” that matches up travelers online with people looking to rent out rooms or entire homes, is close to securing fresh funding that would value the business at $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported this morning.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz###2574||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

(See also: Investors not buying gold bounce despite Ukraine tension)

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2560||Empty###2561||Empty###2562||Airbnb, the website emblematic of the “sharing economy” that matches up travelers online with people looking to rent out rooms or entire homes, is close to securing fresh funding that would value the business at $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported this morning.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz###2574||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

(See also: Investors not buying gold bounce despite Ukraine tension)

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this. In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###2555||Empty###2556||Deals Rumor Mill: Airbnb, Strauss-Kahn, Whampoa

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this. In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###2555||Empty###2556||Deals Rumor Mill: Airbnb, Strauss-Kahn, Whampoa

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2560||Empty###2561||Empty###2562||Airbnb, the website emblematic of the “sharing economy” that matches up travelers online with people looking to rent out rooms or entire homes, is close to securing fresh funding that would value the business at $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported this morning.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.
