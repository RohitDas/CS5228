1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake.
The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.
The first coin to embed banknote-like securityAlthough it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins.
There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin.
While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects.###1916||Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg Yves Mersch warned that failing to reach a deal on the last element of the banking union would be 'close to suicide'Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.
The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.
EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded.
Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.
The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million.
The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.
But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present.
A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.###1923||IRS warns of largest phone scam everShare This Story:TwitterFacebookLinkedinMore(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.
