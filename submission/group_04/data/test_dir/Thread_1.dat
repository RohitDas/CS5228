639||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||Siemens said it would raise its dividend after solid full-year results in the latest example of how the German engineering giant, after years of living in the shadow of rival GE, is beginning to outshine its U.S. nemesis.###641||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. staked out sharply divergent views from the Federal Reserve over how well they would perform in a market shock, as the central bank gauges the strength of U.S. lenders. Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”639||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###653||Rhode Island had highest unemployment rate in the U.S. in January with a rate of 9.2 percent, according to the latest data from U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||Siemens said it would raise its dividend after solid full-year results in the latest example of how the German engineering giant, after years of living in the shadow of rival GE, is beginning to outshine its U.S. nemesis.###641||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. staked out sharply divergent views from the Federal Reserve over how well they would perform in a market shock, as the central bank gauges the strength of U.S. lenders. Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###653||Rhode Island had highest unemployment rate in the U.S. in January with a rate of 9.2 percent, according to the latest data from U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics.

It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections.

The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build.

Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”639||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world.

In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###653||Rhode Island had highest unemployment rate in the U.S. in January with a rate of 9.2 percent, according to the latest data from U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics.

(Journal Staff)###654||With Colorado legalizing marijuana for recreational use, making it legal to grow up to six plants for an individual, other states are looking at getting on the weed wagon. Many already are, decriminalizing possession of smaller amounts of pot, as well as legalization for medical purposes.

Sales in Colorado have been stellar, and the state is reaping the benefits, big time. In the first month alone, licensed dispensaries hit a whopping $14 million dollars in sales, and the state received a cool $2 million of those proceeds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year — about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

And then there is big tobacco, with companies seeing a serious decline in sales in the U.S., are forced to turn their markets to other countries, and pushing their deadly fares in China, Russia and India, to name a few. Smokers in the US have dropped to less than half of the people who smoked in the 1950’s. Smokers are becoming a thing of the past. It is a known fact that tobacco kills and as such, many states have banned smoking in any public buildings or structures.

With the popularity of tobacco declining, and the popularity of marijuana on the rise, following the medical marijuana legalization in 20 states and recreational legalization in Colorado and Washington, and at least 58 percent of Americans agreeing that it should be legalized, it appears pot already has replaced tobacco smoking in America, and the tobacco industry would be crazy not to get on board.

With all of this cash to be made from an alternative smoking product, why not? However, when the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was asked the question about the future intentions of its company, spokesman Bill Phelps told CBS: “We have a practice of not commenting or speculating on future business. Adding, tobacco companies are in the business of manufacturing and marketing tobacco products.”

But one can rest assured, if governments continue to treat smoking as the public health menace it is, the tobacco industry may not have a future at all, at least in the U.S. And as marijuana popularity continues to grow, thereby inadvertently replacing tobacco products, it could save their imminent decline, so it makes perfect sense.

But there is another entity that could take the marijuana boom to a new level, and that is the liquor industry.

The Washington State Liquor Control Board is receiving plenty of applications from people who want to be certified to be able to grow pot legally, even though the agency is not yet soliciting such applications. The agency’s spokesman Brian Smith said Tuesday that some applications so far have come from people who have long been growing marijuana when it was against state law.

“We’re getting a lot of interest from people that want to be producers,” Smith said. “Some say they have been growing it illegally until now.”

Where pot will go commercially is still unknown, but it is bound to happen soon.

There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||Siemens said it would raise its dividend after solid full-year results in the latest example of how the German engineering giant, after years of living in the shadow of rival GE, is beginning to outshine its U.S. nemesis.###641||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. staked out sharply divergent views from the Federal Reserve over how well they would perform in a market shock, as the central bank gauges the strength of U.S. lenders. Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||Siemens said it would raise its dividend after solid full-year results in the latest example of how the German engineering giant, after years of living in the shadow of rival GE, is beginning to outshine its U.S. nemesis.###641||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. staked out sharply divergent views from the Federal Reserve over how well they would perform in a market shock, as the central bank gauges the strength of U.S. lenders. Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||Siemens said it would raise its dividend after solid full-year results in the latest example of how the German engineering giant, after years of living in the shadow of rival GE, is beginning to outshine its U.S. nemesis.###641||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. staked out sharply divergent views from the Federal Reserve over how well they would perform in a market shock, as the central bank gauges the strength of U.S. lenders. Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.
